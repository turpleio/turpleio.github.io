VM instances are controlled by Turple and can be scaled in/out as required. If an engineer decides to scale in/out, it can be done manually with simple commands. However, the monitoring system of Turple keeps checking the service status and execute scaling job automatically. The alarm system can also alert engineers through Slack when detecting unusual condition.
