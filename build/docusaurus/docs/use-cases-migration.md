Many companies are running their services applications on premise. Although their applications are deployed on a cloud infrastructure, in most cases the service architecture does not change from it used to be on premise. This is the point which many companies are struggling with when they try to make their cloud native applications.

Regardless of cloud service providers the first thing the companies need to do is to containerize their services. Containerized applications are essential for microservice. Once service containers are ready, it's very easy to deploy into Turple. Then the services become the cloud native service, which is high availability, heterogeneous, scalable, resilient and manageable.
