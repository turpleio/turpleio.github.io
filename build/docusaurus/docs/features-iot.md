For IoT services, the server must have sufficient capacity to receive large amount of signal data. Turple's IoT module supports MQTT protocol and its capacity is very large and provides various security options. To store various types of data, you can use Redis as an in-memory database, MongoDB as a consistent database and InfluxDB as a time series database can be installed in Turple environment. Of course, other databases like MySql or Postgres are available.
