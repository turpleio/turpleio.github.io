DevOps is necessary to make a true cloud native service. When Turple receives a push notification from Github, the updated code is built and the new created container is automatically deployed to designated instances by Turple's CI/CD process.

Turple environment can be integrated on a single instance and this is very useful when you want to develop and verify the services with a small set.

Turple provides four types of environment by default, Dev, Test, Staging and Product. Each environment consists of the same components and has completely separated workspace. You can use the environments as your service needs.
