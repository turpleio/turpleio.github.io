QuestDB hosted services and websites (collectively, the “Website” or “Websites”)
and self-managed installations, which are offered by QuestDB Technology Inc
and/or any of its affiliates (“QuestDB” or “we” or “us”). Please read this
Privacy Notice carefully. By accessing or using any part of the Websites or
self-managed installations, you acknowledge you have been informed of and
consent to our practices with regard to your personal information and data.</p><p>QuestDB is an open source project and collaborative community, as well as a
company. This means that many portions of our Websites, including information
you voluntarily provide, will be public-facing for the open sharing of
innovative developments, ideas, and information that makes our collaborative
community so great. While we are committed to open sharing, we strive to respect
the privacy of individual community members and will minimize the information we
collect and share. If you do not want to share your information, including
personally identifiable information, with other community members and the
public, please be thoughtful as to how you interact with our Websites and what
information you provide through the Websites (for example, through creating a
public profile, project contributions, comments, and blog posts).</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="data-protection"></a>Data Protection<a class="hash-link" href="#data-protection" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Oversight of Data Security is handled by QuestDB&#x27;s respective Data
Protection Officers. Should you wish to make modifications, deletions, or
additions to any personal data you believe to be captured by QuestDB, or if you
have any general security concerns, please contact us at
<a href="mailto:privacy@questdb.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">privacy@questdb.io</a>.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="what-information-questdb-collects-and-why"></a>What Information QuestDB Collects and Why<a class="hash-link" href="#what-information-questdb-collects-and-why" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="information-from-website-visitors"></a>Information from Website Visitors<a class="hash-link" href="#information-from-website-visitors" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>Like most website operators, QuestDB collects basic non-personally-identifying
information from Website visitors of the sort that web browsers and servers
typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference,
referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. We collect this
information to better understand how visitors use the Website, to improve our
Websites and experience for visitors, and to monitor the security of the
Websites. From time to time, QuestDB may publicly release
non-personally-identifying information collected from Website visitors in the
aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of the Website.</p><p>QuestDB also collects potentially personally-identifying information like
Internet Protocol (IP) addresses from visitors. QuestDB does not use such
information to identify or track individual visitors, however. We collect this
information to understand how visitors use the Websites, to improve performance
and content, and to monitor the security of the Websites.</p><p>QuestDB may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to our Websites.
For instance, QuestDB may reveal how many downloads can be attributed to a
particular software version using aggregated statistics that contain anonymous
user information only.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="usage-data-information-from-self-managed-questdb-instances"></a>Usage Data Information from Self-managed QuestDB Instances<a class="hash-link" href="#usage-data-information-from-self-managed-questdb-instances" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>QuestDB collects anonymous application usage data from each self-managed QuestDB
instance (Open Source and Enterprise Edition). It is possible to
<a href="/docs/reference/configuration#telemetry">opt out of application telemetry</a>
being transferred, and for self-managed QuestDB instances, we do not track end
users.</p><p>Telemetry data that is being collected include:</p><ul><li>The protocol used to interact with an instance API</li><li>The type of event used via this protocol</li><li>The time and frequency of these events</li><li>An anonymous identifier of the instance</li><li>The Class C network the telemetry data is sent from</li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="personally-identifying-information"></a>Personally-Identifying Information<a class="hash-link" href="#personally-identifying-information" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Users of the Websites may choose to interact with QuestDB in ways that provide
us with their personally-identifying information. In some instances, a User ID
is generated for form and url tracking, page views, page pings and usage counts
in order to ascertain product performance and development. The amount and type
of information that QuestDB gathers depends on the nature of your interaction
with us, as well as the amount of information you choose to share. For example,
we ask visitors who use our community slack group to provide a username and
email address. We will also collect the information you provide with us in
connection with creating an account on the Website. Profile information is
shared publicly, as well as activity under your profile. If you report a
security vulnerability to QuestDB and request public acknowledgment, then we may
publicly disclose the personal information you provided to us in connection with
the report, including your name to fulfill your request for acknowledgment. In
each case, QuestDB collects such personally-identifiable information only
insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the user’s
interaction with or request of QuestDB. We will not disclose
personally-identifying information other than as described in this Privacy
Notice.</p><p>Visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with
the caveat that it may prevent you from engaging in certain Website-related
activities or being able to access and use certain features and services.</p><p>For details about what information is collected and with whom it is shared,
please go to What Information QuestDB Collects and Why.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="where-we-store-your-data"></a>Where We Store Your Data<a class="hash-link" href="#where-we-store-your-data" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>As part of the services offered to you, for example through our Website, the
information you provide to us may be transferred to and stored in countries
outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) as we use remote website server
hosts to provide the website and some aspects of our service, which may be based
outside of the EEA, or use servers based outside of the EEA - this is generally
the nature of data stored in “the Cloud”. It may also be processed by staff
operating outside the EEA who work for one of our suppliers, e.g. our website
server host, or work for us when temporarily outside of the EEA.</p><p>A transfer of your personal data may happen if any of our servers are located in
a country outside of the EEA or one of our service providers is located in a
country outside of the EEA. If we transfer or store your personal data outside
the EEA in this way, we will take steps with the aim of ensuring that your
privacy rights continue to be protected, as outlined in this privacy policy and
in accordance with the DPA and GDPR. If you use our service while you are
outside the EEA, your personal data may be transferred outside the EEA in order
to provide you with these services.</p><p>We do not use or disclose sensitive personal data, such as race, religion, or
political affiliations, without your explicit consent.</p><p>We may disclose your personal data outside of our group: (a) in the event that
we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your
personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets; and
(b) if QuestDB’s business is bought by a third party, in which case personal
data held by it about its customers will be one of the assets to transfer to the
buyer. However, any such transfer will only be on terms that the confidentiality
of your personal data is protected and that the terms of this privacy policy
will continue to be complied with by the recipient.</p><p>Otherwise, we will process, disclose or share your personal data only if
required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is
necessary to comply with legal requirements or legal process served on us or the
website. By giving us your personal data, you agree to this arrangement. We will
do what we reasonably can to keep your data secure. You have the right to opt
out of our processing your personal data for marketing purposes by contacting us
at <a href="mailto:privacy@questdb.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">privacy@questdb.io</a>.</p><p>Although we try to provide protection, we cannot guarantee complete security for
your data, and you take the risk that any sending of that data turns out to be
not secure despite our efforts.</p><p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfill the
purposes we collected it for as described above in section 6, including for the
purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements, and/or
for as long as we have your permission to keep it. To determine the appropriate
retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and
sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized
use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your
personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and
the applicable legal requirements. In any event, we will conduct an annual
review to ascertain whether we need to keep your personal data. Your personal
data will be deleted if we no longer need it.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="information-questdb-does-not-collect"></a>Information QuestDB Does Not Collect<a class="hash-link" href="#information-questdb-does-not-collect" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>QuestDB does not intentionally collect sensitive personal information, such as
social security numbers, genetic data, health information, or religious
information. Although QuestDB does not request or intentionally collect any
sensitive personal information, we realize that users might store this kind of
information in a QuestDB instance by pushing it to us through our libraries or
API. If you store any sensitive personal information on QuestDB’s servers, you
are consenting to our storage of that information.</p><p>If you&#x27;re a child under the age of 13, you may not have an account on the
Website. QuestDB does not knowingly collect information from or direct any of
our Website or content specifically to children under 13. If we learn or have
reason to suspect that a user is under the age of 13, we will close the child’s
account.</p><p>Other countries may have different minimum age limits. If you are below the
minimum age for providing consent for data collection in your country, you may
not use QuestDB.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="basis-for-processing-your-information"></a>Basis for Processing Your Information<a class="hash-link" href="#basis-for-processing-your-information" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Performance of a contract. The use of your information may be necessary to
perform the contract that you have with us. For example, if you use our Websites
to purchase QuestDB product subscriptions or services, contribute to a project,
create a profile, post and comment through our Websites, or request information
through our Websites, we will use your information to carry out our obligation
to complete and administer that contract or request.</p><p>Legitimate interests. We use your information for our legitimate interests, such
as to provide you with the best content through our Websites and communications
with users and the public, to improve and promote our products and services, and
for administrative, security, fraud prevention and legal purposes.</p><p>Consent. We may rely on your consent to use your personal information for
certain direct marketing purposes, such as sending you newsletter updates about
QuestDB products. You may withdraw your consent at any time through the
unsubscribe feature provided with each marketing email or by contacting us at
the addresses given at the end of this Privacy Notice.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="how-questdb-uses-and-protects-personally-identifying-information"></a>How QuestDB Uses and Protects Personally-Identifying Information<a class="hash-link" href="#how-questdb-uses-and-protects-personally-identifying-information" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="sharing-your-information"></a>Sharing Your Information<a class="hash-link" href="#sharing-your-information" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>QuestDB only discloses potentially personally-identifying and
personally-identifying information to those of its employees, contractors, and
affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to
process it on QuestDB&#x27;s behalf or to provide services available on the
Website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others.</p><p>Please note, email and IP addresses of users of a QuestDB deployment may be
shared with the respective users of that deployment.</p><p>QuestDB will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and
personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees,
contractors, and affiliated organizations, as described above, QuestDB discloses
potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only
when required to do so by law, or when QuestDB believes in good faith that
disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of QuestDB,
third parties, or the public at large.</p><p>QuestDB takes measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized
access, use, alteration, or destruction of potentially personally-identifying
and personally-identifying information.</p><p>QuestDB at its sole discretion may make use of company logos where those
companies are using the software that we provide. If you have concerns over the
use of your logo, please email <a href="mailto:logos@questdb.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">logos@questdb.io</a>.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="international-transfer-of-information"></a>International Transfer of Information<a class="hash-link" href="#international-transfer-of-information" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>Our employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that process information
for us as described above may be located in regions other than your home
country; by using the Website, you consent to the international transfer of your
information by QuestDB. QuestDB will take appropriate steps to ensure that
transfers of personal information are in accordance with applicable law and
carefully managed to protect your privacy rights and interests.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="questdb-communications-with-you"></a>QuestDB Communications with You<a class="hash-link" href="#questdb-communications-with-you" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>If you are a registered user of the Websites and have supplied your email
address, QuestDB may occasionally send you an email to inform you about
security, system information, new features, solicit your feedback, or send
QuestDB product updates. We primarily use our blog to communicate this
information, so we aim to keep this type of email communication to a minimum. An
unsubscribe link is located at the bottom of each marketing email to allow
recipients to update their email preferences and to opt out of such emails.</p><p>If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our
feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish your request in order to
help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. We
will not publish your personally-identifiable information in connection with
your request.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="cookies-tracking-technologies-and-do-not-track"></a>Cookies, Tracking Technologies and Do Not Track<a class="hash-link" href="#cookies-tracking-technologies-and-do-not-track" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="cookies"></a>Cookies<a class="hash-link" href="#cookies" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor&#x27;s
computer, and that the visitor&#x27;s browser provides to the website each time
the visitor returns. QuestDB uses cookies to help QuestDB identify and track
visitors, their usage of the Websites, and their Website access preferences.
QuestDB visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers may
set their browsers to refuse cookies before using the Websites. Disabling
browser cookies may cause certain features of QuestDB&#x27;s websites to not
function properly.</p><p>Certain pages on the Website may set other third party cookies. For example, we
may embed content, such as videos, from another site that sets a cookie. These
sites set their own cookies and we do not have access or control over these
cookies. The use of cookies by third parties is not covered by our Privacy
Notice.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="tracking-technologies"></a>Tracking Technologies<a class="hash-link" href="#tracking-technologies" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>We may use third party tracking services, but we don’t use these services to
track you individually or collect your personally identifiable-information. We
may use these services to collect information about how the Website performs and
how users navigate through and use the Website so we can monitor and improve our
content and Website performance.</p><p>Third party tracking services gather certain simple, non-personally identifying
information over time, such as your IP address, browser type, internet service
provider, referring and exit pages, timestamp, and similar data about your use
of the Website. We do not link this information to any of your personal
information such as your user name.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="do-not-track"></a>Do Not Track<a class="hash-link" href="#do-not-track" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>&quot;Do Not Track&quot; is a privacy preference you can set in your browser if
you do not want online services to collect and share certain kinds of
information about your online activity from third party tracking services.
QuestDB does not track your online browsing activity on other online services
over time and we do not permit third-party services to track your activity on
our site beyond our basic tracking, which you may opt out of. Because we do not
share this kind of data with third party services or permit this kind of third
party data collection for any of our users, and we do not track our users on
third-party websites ourselves, we do not need to respond differently to an
individual browser&#x27;s Do Not Track setting.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="global-privacy-practices"></a>Global Privacy Practices<a class="hash-link" href="#global-privacy-practices" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>We understand that users from other countries may have different expectations
and rights with regard to their privacy. For all Website visitors and users, no
matter their country of location, we will:</p><ul><li>provide clear methods of unambiguous, informed consent when we do collect your
personal information;</li><li>only collect the minimum amount of personal data necessary for the purpose it
is collected for, unless you choose to provide us more;</li><li>offer you simple methods of accessing, correcting, or deleting your
information that we have collected, with the exception of information you
voluntarily provide that is necessary to retain as is for the integrity of our
project code as described further below; and</li><li>provide Website users notice, choice, accountability, security, and access,
and we limit the purpose for processing. We also provide our users a method of
recourse and enforcement.</li></ul><p>If you are located in the European Union, you are entitled to the following
rights with regard to your personal information and data:</p><ul><li>Right of access to your personal data, to know what information about you we
hold</li><li>Right to correct any incorrect or incomplete personal data about yourself that
we hold</li><li>Right to restrict/suspend our processing of your personal data</li><li>Right to complain to a supervisory authority if you believe your privacy
rights are being violated</li></ul><p>Additional rights that may apply to you in certain instances:</p><ul><li>Right of data portability (if our processing is based on consent and automated
means)</li><li>Right to withdraw consent at any time (if processing is based on consent)</li><li>Right to object to processing (if processing is based on legitimate interests)</li><li>Right to object to processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes</li><li>Right of erasure of your personal data from our system (“right to be
forgotten”) if certain grounds are met</li></ul><p>To exercise your privacy rights, you can email us at the address given below in
the ‘Contacting QuestDB About Your Privacy’ section of this Privacy Notice.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="data-retention-and-deletion"></a>Data Retention and Deletion<a class="hash-link" href="#data-retention-and-deletion" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>If you already have an account on the Websites, you may access, update, alter,
or delete your basic user profile information by logging into your account and
updating profile settings.</p><p>QuestDB will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as
needed to perform our contractual obligations, provide you services through the
Website, to comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, preserve legal
rights, or enforce our agreements.</p><p>Please note that due to the open source nature of our products, services, and
community, we may retain limited personally-identifiable information
indefinitely in order to ensure transactional integrity and non-repudiation. For
example, if you provide your information in connection with a blog post, GitHub
issue or comment, we may display that information even if you have deleted your
account as we do not automatically delete community posts. Also, as described in
our Terms of Use, if you contribute to a QuestDB project and provide your
personal information in connection with that contribution, that information
(including your name) will be embedded and publicly displayed with your
contribution and we will not be able to delete or erase it because doing so
would break the project code.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="contacting-questdb-about-your-privacy"></a>Contacting QuestDB About Your Privacy<a class="hash-link" href="#contacting-questdb-about-your-privacy" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>If you have questions or concerns about the way we are handling your
