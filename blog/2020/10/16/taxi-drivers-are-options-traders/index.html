ends meet as a driver. Using a dataset of over 1.6 billion taxi rides, 700
million FHV rides (Uber, Lyft, etc.), and 10 years of weather and gas prices
data, I examine whether the antiquated meter system impacts NYC cabbies&#x27;
livelihood, rather than competition from the likes of Uber.</p><p>A few of months ago, I was putting together data for QuestDB&#x27;s demo that we
shared on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23616878" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ShowHN</a>. It has been a
while since I left derivatives trading, and was not expecting to end up writing
about options pricing. Much to my surprise, the economics of a taxi meter are
very similar to options. This provides an interesting perspective into the fate
of taxi drivers.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="the-economics-of-the-taxi-meter"></a>The economics of the taxi meter<a class="hash-link" href="#the-economics-of-the-taxi-meter" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Most rides are priced using the
<a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/passengers/taxi-fare.page" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">standard meter system</a>.
The meter is a machine, which calculates the price of a ride based on inputs
such as time, speed, and distance. Additionally, it adds taxes, tolls and
surcharges depending on a variety of factors such as the route taken or the time
of the day.</p><p>Most of the driver&#x27;s earnings come from the <code>fare</code>, which consists of a
<code>flat fare</code> $2.50 for entering the cab, and a <code>variable fare</code>. The variable
fare is a function of speed, time and distance. It is calculated as follows:</p><ul><li>When the cab drives above 12mph, $2.50 per mile</li><li>Otherwise, $0.50 per minute</li></ul><p>This post focuses on the variable fare, i.e the output of the meter excluding
the $2.50 start fee and extras. To be able to compare rides with one another,
we normalize it as an <code>hourly rate</code> of driving a customer around.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="modelling-variable-earnings-for-taxi-drivers"></a>Modelling variable earnings for taxi drivers<a class="hash-link" href="#modelling-variable-earnings-for-taxi-drivers" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Let&#x27;s assume a cab is driving a customer at a constant speed during one hour. At
the end of the hour, the driver can expect to pocket <code>variable earnings</code> of:</p><ul><li>$30 if they drove below 12mph ($0.50 a minute)</li><li>$2.50 x their average speed if they drove above 12mph</li></ul><p>Let&#x27;s plot the hourly earnings in function of speed. This instantly reminds me
of an old friend: call options!</p><figure><img alt="A chart of call option payoff showing how cab drivers earnings increase with their average realized driving speed" class="image_Pw1y margin_Rc0b shadow_7z-4" src="/img/blog/2020-10-16/cab-hourly-earnings-by-speed.png"></figure><p>Rewriting the fare formula as follows, we recognize the call option formula
<code>Max(0, S-K)</code>.</p><p><code>Hourly Fare = 30 + max(0, Speed - 12)</code></p><p>Interestingly, the above notation breaks down the hourly variable fare into two
components.</p><ul><li>A <code>guaranteed</code> component <code>30</code>: whenever driving a customer, a cab will make at
least $30 an hour.</li><li>An <code>optional</code> component <code>max(0, Speed - 12)</code>: driving customers faster earns
the driver more.</li></ul><p>Graphically, the breakdown between <code>guaranteed</code> and <code>optional</code> fare components
look like the below:</p><figure><img alt="A chart of call option payoff showing how cab drivers earnings increase with their average realized driving speed broken down between fixed and variable" class="image_Pw1y margin_Rc0b shadow_7z-4" src="/img/blog/2020-10-16/cab-hourly-earnings-by-speed-breakdown.png"></figure><p>There is a reason for this system. It is designed to align the interests of
drivers and riders:</p><ul><li>The <code>guaranteed</code> part makes discourages riders from making the driver wait and
ensures they are paid for their time.</li><li>The <code>optional</code> part discourages drivers from purposefully taking customers
through traffic.</li></ul><p>Let&#x27;s try to quantify the value of the optional part by using options pricing
methods in order to study the incentive for drivers.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="a-simple-approach-to-options-pricing"></a>A simple approach to options pricing<a class="hash-link" href="#a-simple-approach-to-options-pricing" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>This post isnât meant as an essay in financial mathematics (far from it).
However, before we continue, it is useful to understand what makes options
valuable. Buying an option is like paying to play a game with a monetary payout
contingent on some <code>variable</code>.</p><p>As an example, think of a dice game. If the die value (our variable) is below 2,
you receive 0. Otherwise, you receive the difference between that value and 2.
In financial markets, the threshold of 2 is known as the <code>strike price</code> and is
denoted K.</p><p><strong>You have to pay a fee to play this game. How much are you ready to pay?</strong></p><p>To find out, we need to calculate the expected value of a game. This is easy
since we know all <code>possible outcomes</code> and their
<code>respective probabilities of occurrence</code>. We can write these in the table below:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Dice value</th><th>Probability</th><th>Payout</th><th>Weighed payout</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>16.66%</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>16.66%</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>16.66%</td><td>1</td><td>0.1666</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>16.66%</td><td>2</td><td>0.3332</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>16.66%</td><td>3</td><td>0.4998</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>16.66%</td><td>4</td><td>0.6664</td></tr></tbody></table><p>By summing all the potential payouts weighed by their probability, we compute
the expected value of playing this game: $1.666.</p><ul><li>If we pay less to play the game, we will make money over time.</li><li>If we pay more, we lose in the long run.</li></ul><p>This example shows that in its simplest form, the value of an option is equal to
the product of the payout profile and the associated probability distribution
when the option expires. Letâs visualize this by plotting the values for our
game in the following chart:</p><figure><img alt="A chart showing the outcome profile of the dice game and the corresponding probabilities and probability-weighed expected payout values" class="image_Pw1y margin_Rc0b shadow_7z-4" src="/img/blog/2020-10-16/die-game-payout-profile.png"></figure><p>where:</p><ul><li>The white dashed line represents the possible (discrete) payouts for the game.</li><li>The cyan dotted line is the probability for each outcome (dice value) to
occur. It is a straight line at 16.66% since each of the 6 values is
equiprobable.</li><li>The coloured area is the product of the first two lines. Its total surface is
the value of our option.</li></ul><p>Of course, this is very simplified. I omit time value, which is the idea that
you (almost) always wish you could hold the option for longer. The reason time
value exists has to do with the asymmetric payoff profile: there is more to win
than to lose by waiting a little longer. Also, in real life, outcomes are rarely
equiprobable. For example, stock prices are represented as a log-normal
distribution. Nevertheless, this example gives a good introduction to calculate
the value of an option.</p><p>Now, since we saw that speed is the main driver behind the variable fare, we
should attempt to build a representation of speed distribution in order to
estimate the option value.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="modelling-cabs-speed-and-option-value"></a>Modelling cabs speed and option value<a class="hash-link" href="#modelling-cabs-speed-and-option-value" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>This can be done using a log-normal distribution, which is analogous to the
normal distribution, but cannot be negative. This fits our situation well since
cabs can only drive above 0mph.</p><p>The log-normal distribution requires two parameters:</p><ul><li>the <code>mean</code>, i.e a driver&#x27;s expected average speed for a given hour.</li><li>the <code>standard deviation</code>, a measure of how much the achieved speed is likely
to deviate from the mean.</li></ul><p>If we overlay the log-normal distribution to the option payoff, we can see the
option value below as the product of the two surface areas. As you can see, the
log-normal distribution is skewed to the left and the mode (the highest point on
the distribution, at around 10 mph) is lower than the mean (13 mph in the
above).</p><figure><img alt="A chart of call option payoff with the corresponding probability and weighed value area as overlay" class="image_Pw1y margin_Rc0b shadow_7z-4" src="/img/blog/2020-10-16/option-payoff-probability-value.png"></figure><p>We can play with our two parameters to get a grasp on the pricing dynamics. Here
is how the average speed changes the distribution and expected option value:</p><figure><img alt="A chart showing how distribution of outcomes and value change with the expected mean" class="image_Pw1y margin_Rc0b shadow_7z-4" src="/img/blog/2020-10-16/payout-change-with-avg.png"></figure><p>And here is the effect of standard deviation:</p><figure><img alt="A chart showing how distribution of outcomes and value change with the standard deviation" class="image_Pw1y margin_Rc0b shadow_7z-4" src="/img/blog/2020-10-16/payout-change-with-stdev.png"></figure><p>We can see that a higher mean and a higher standard deviation result in higher
option value. In short, this means that it is in the drivers&#x27; best interests to</p><ul><li>drive faster;</li><li>deviate for the mean, for example by taking risks.</li></ul><p>Now, to be clear, I don&#x27;t mean that they should drive recklessly, but rather
that they should attempt &quot;risky&quot; routes, which could either save a lot of time,
or otherwise be a disaster.</p><p>In traditional finance, the sensitivities to input parameters, which we have
introduced above are called the âGreeksâ. These are measures of risk named
(mostly) after Greek letters. They are used to evaluate and manage the risk of
options portfolios. Here are the two greeks respective to the mean and standard
deviation:</p><ul><li>The <code>delta</code>, change of option value relative to change of the mean</li><li>The <code>vega</code>, change of value relative to the change of standard deviation (aka
volatility).</li></ul><p>These are &quot;first order&quot; greeks, which means they directly affect the option
value. There are more greeks, of higher order, which affect the option value
indirectly. As example, the <code>vanna</code> is a second-order greek which measures how
much the delta (first order greek) of an option changes when volatility changes.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="traffic-increase-has-cost-a-great-amount-to-taxi-drivers"></a>Traffic increase has cost a great amount to taxi drivers<a class="hash-link" href="#traffic-increase-has-cost-a-great-amount-to-taxi-drivers" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Letâs first look at the average speed over time.</p><p>The NYC taxi dataset gives us the distance calculated by the meter, the pickup
timestamp, and the drop-off timestamp. Using QuestDB, we can derive the duration
of each ride as the difference between the two timestamps and divide the
distance by the duration, to calculate the average speed.</p><p>With <code>SAMPLE BY</code>, I compute the average results for monthly intervals and plot
it below. Over 10 years, the average speed dropped significantly from 13.3 to
9.7mph (almost 30%!).</p><figure><img alt="A chart showing the evolution of the average cab driver speed over time and how it consistently dropped below the threshold" class="image_Pw1y margin_Rc0b shadow_7z-4" src="/img/blog/2020-10-16/average-speed-over-time.png"></figure><p>This number is a simplification since it assumes constant speed and no idle
time. However, it is useful to calculate a lower-bound for earnings as follows.</p><p><code>Min Hourly Variable Fare = Max($30, Avg(speed) * $2.5)</code></p><p>Similarly, we can estimate the upper bound of a driverâs hourly earnings in a
theoretical world where drivers are either idle or accelerate instantly from 0
to the speed limit of 25mph. This is how the maximum potential fare could be
calculated:</p><p><code>Max potential hourly variable fare = Distance component + Idle component</code></p><p><code>Distance component = Average ride distance * $2.50 / Average ride duration (hours)</code></p><p>and</p><p><code>Idle component = (25 - Average ride distance)/25mph * 60min * $0.50</code></p><p>Lastly, we can calculate the actual average variable fare over time as follows.</p><p><code>Actual Hourly Variable Fare =avg(fare_amount - $2.50) / avg(duration_hours) </code></p><p>Here is what the three metrics look like over time (note we started the plot in
September 2012 since cab prices were increased in August 2012. Interestingly,
the average minimum variable fare has dropped over time and is now hitting a
floor.</p><figure><img alt="A chart showing the evolution of the average cab driver potential fare range against the actual average fare" class="image_Pw1y margin_Rc0b shadow_7z-4" src="/img/blog/2020-10-16/potential-average-fare-range.png"></figure><p>Now that we have the average speed, we can use the standard deviation to model
the speed distribution. By feeding the historical mean and standard deviations
into a log-normal distribution model, we can compute the following percentiles.
For the vast majority of rides, drivers can expect to average below 12mph.</p><figure><img alt="A chart showing the evolution of the distribution of NYC cab drivers&#x27; average speed over time" class="image_Pw1y margin_Rc0b shadow_7z-4" src="/img/blog/2020-10-16/distribution-speed-over-time.png"></figure><p>To sum up, the following chart shows how the economics have changed over time.
We can see how this damaged the option value for drivers, mostly as a result of
the lower trending mean.</p><figure><img alt="A chart showing how the distribution of outcomes changes due to a lower mean, and the resulting change in option" class="image_Pw1y margin_Rc0b shadow_7z-4" src="/img/blog/2020-10-16/distribution-shift-with-lower-mean.png"></figure><p>We can now use our data to extract the actual option value from the fare as
follows.</p><p><code>Option value = Hourly variable fare - Guaranteed component</code></p><p><code>Option value Actual = Actual Hourly Variable Fare - $30</code></p><p>Slowly but surely, it stopped being a significant part in the driverâs earnings.</p><figure><img alt="A chart of the hourly fare earned by taxi drivers over the years broken down by whether it is fixed or variable" class="image_Pw1y margin_Rc0b shadow_7z-4" src="/img/blog/2020-10-16/variable-hourly-fare-over-time.png"></figure><p>I donât have the data to tell why the average speed is lower, but I would
intuitively attribute this to more vehicles on the road as a result of Uber,
Lyft, and other FHV, along with urban planning, for example cycle lanes making
for less space on the road and more congestion.</p><p>Whatever the underlying reasons, the impact is visible, and it is significant.
Over the past 10 years, slower traffic has cost up to
$10/hour per taxi. To put
this in context, this means $29,000/driver each year (8
hours a day, no holidays), or
$300 million a year for the entire NYC cab industry! And these are
lower bound numbers. In reality, drivers share cabs. If we assume all of the
13,500 cabs are constantly on the road, this adds up to $1.2
billion a year lost for the industry!</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="customers-are-losing-too"></a>Customers are losing too<a class="hash-link" href="#customers-are-losing-too" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>The pricing system was designed to motivate drivers and riders to play fair.
These incentives are almost gone today, which makes the meter system
counter-productive.</p><p>When the average driver could expect to drive at 13mph 10 years ago, their
expected speed is now around 9mph, way below the 12mph threshold. The loss of
incentive becomes apparent if we look at it over time as follows:</p><figure><img alt="A chart showing how the value of the incentive of driving customers faster has disappeared for NYC cab drivers" class="image_Pw1y margin_Rc0b shadow_7z-4" src="/img/blog/2020-10-16/incentive-value-evolution-over-time.png"></figure><p>So, are there any reasons left for cabs to drive customers around faster?</p><p>The start fee of $2.50 provides another incentive. But it&#x27;s efficacy depends on
the waiting time between two rides. If the expected wait between customers is 5
minutes or less, then drivers remain incentivized. Otherwise, it is economically
more efficient to drive slowly and make the most of the current customer. A
slow-earning loaded cab makes more money than an empty one.</p><p>I donât have data to estimate the waiting time for drivers between two rides.
But in a world with increased supply and competition (Uber, Lyft etc.), I think
it is safe to assume that the wait time for drivers has increased. So while I
cannot tell for sure if the start fee has lost all of its incentive, it seems
fair to say that it lost a good part of it.</p><p>If drivers are uncertain about their likelihood of finding the next ride, and if
the optional fare component has become an insignificant fraction of their
earnings, then it makes more sense to drive slow, and to hold on to the current
customer for as long as possible. In the end, $30 per hour is better than 0.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_WiXH" id="your-turn-to-explore-the-data"></a>Your turn to explore the data<a class="hash-link" href="#your-turn-to-explore-the-data" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>We made this dataset and the database available online and you can query it
